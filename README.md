OpenFrameworks-ng
=================

OpenFrameworks 64bit/C++11 port and legacy API removal.

Not under active development, sort of hit a roadblock, but I hope something in here might be useful to others.

TODO:
*Replace GLUT with NSOpenGL

*Find a better way of handling the jhbuild dependencies, or at least find a way to automate it & build it local to the project tree.
